I struggled to download the jdk I had some error come up were my code wouldn't run because of it and I took a long time trying to figure it out but a video online helped me quickly even though I strugled for a long time. Java is kind of like c c++ more than python because its more specific with dentations. Python is more simple of a lanuage and give you a basic understanding to understand java. I did not attend anu sessions. My advice would be if you get an error you really don't know there are videos online that will help you not struggle for so long.
